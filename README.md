### Hey ðŸ‘‹

With a background in Applied Mathematics and Computer Science, my journey has taken me to the development of AI-based solutions and services.

My experience working on CV consulting projects, which were highlighted at Apple WWDC, and the development of Plug & Play AI products has led me to create **Kopikat** â€” a tool designed to augment datasets using Generative AI. This enhances models, making them more robust and adaptive, particularly in hard-case scenarios.
